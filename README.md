That’s where the 🎒 comes in. I love to be prepared and always learning. 
Conscientious me is inclined to agree with Louisa May Alcott’s Amy March, “I want to be great or nothing.” 🎨
Honestly, I don’t believe I was born great, nor expect it to be thrust upon me, but seek to achieve greatness through grit and readiness.
