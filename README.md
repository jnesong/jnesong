ABOUT ME:

If you saw me at a coffee shop, you'd probably notice I'm a 5'3" Asian American coffee drinker, with a backpack, typing. Typing what? I’m coding web dev projects or writing a story! If not, then I’m reading. Love for reading comes from my curious, creative spirit, and conscientious enthusiasm to do well. To write and code well, we must read.

☕️ At the coffee shop, I’ve probably been buckled down, focused for hours. Another long standing trait. But when I’m not in the zone, my husband and I are pursuing community. We find great purpose in good company, e.g. where everyone feels welcomed and valued. And I think we’re pretty good at building it. People often tell me I’m a good listener.

I am also evidently adaptable, accustomed to steep learning curves. In the last five years I’ve become (a/an): university graduate, resident in 3 different cities, registered nurse at 3 different highly-ranked, hospitals (alongside the most incredible humans), first-time dog mom, first-time homeowner, first-time aunt (now to 3 nieces), fiance and now wife, masters student (at one of the top 10 Family Nurse Practitioner Programs in the US- then realized it was not the profession for me), and graduate of Flatiron School’s software engineering bootcamp. TLDR: 🎓🏙 🩺 🐕‍🦺 🏡 🍼 💍 📚 👩🏻‍💻

🎒 That’s where the backpack comes in. I love to be prepared and always learning. Conscientious me is inclined to agree with Louisa May Alcott’s Amy March, “I want to be great or nothing.” Honestly, I don’t believe I was born great, nor expect it to be thrust upon me, but seek to achieve greatness through grit and readiness.

I’m still figuring things out. And I’m enjoying the process! As per Mark Watney's motto in The Martian, “You solve one problem and you solve the next one and then the next.” 🚀
